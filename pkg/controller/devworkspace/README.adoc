= Devworkspace Che controller

This is an import of originally standalone Devworkspace Che operator.
As such many things, that could be shared or reused with/from the rest
of the che-operator codebase, aren't. 

This situation will hopefully improve over time as we integrate the two
codebases more and more.

In particular, the `controller/devworkspace/sync` subpackage is more 
or less identical to `deploy/sync` and should be replaced by `deploy/sync`
after a careful inspection, if possible.
