    A collaborative Kubernetes-native development solution that delivers OpenShift workspaces and in-browser IDE for rapid cloud application development.
    This operator installs PostgreSQL, Plugin and Devfile registries, Dashboard, Gateway and the Eclipse Che server, as well as configures all these services.
    OpenShift OAuth is used directly for authentication. TLS mode is on.

    ## How to Install
    Press the **Install** button, choose the channel and the upgrade strategy, and wait for the **Installed** Operator status.
    When the operator is installed, create a new Custom Resource (CR) of Kind CheCluster (click the **Create New** button).
    The CR spec contains all defaults. You can start using Eclipse Che when the CR status is set to **Available**, and you see a URL to Eclipse Che.

    ## Defaults
    By default, the operator deploys Eclipse Che with:
    * 10Gi storage
    * Auto-generated passwords
    * Bundled PostgreSQL
    * Bundled Plugin and Devfile registries

    Use `oc edit checluster/eclipse-che -n eclipse-che` to update Eclipse Che default installation options.
    See more in the [Installation guide](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/configuring-the-che-installation/).

    ### Certificates
    Operator uses a default router certificate to secure Eclipse Che routes.
    Follow the [guide](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/importing-untrusted-tls-certificates/)
    to import certificates into Eclipse Che.
