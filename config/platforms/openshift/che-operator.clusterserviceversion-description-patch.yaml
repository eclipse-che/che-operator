    A collaborative Kubernetes-native development solution that delivers OpenShift workspaces and in-browser IDE for rapid cloud application development.
    This operator installs PostgreSQL, Keycloak, Plugin registry, Devfile registry and the Eclipse Che server, as well as configures all three services.

    ## How to Install
    Press the **Install** button, choose the channel and the upgrade strategy, and wait for the **Installed** Operator status.
    When the operator is installed, create a new CR of Kind CheCluster (click the **Create New** button).
    The CR spec contains all defaults (see below).
    You can start using Eclipse Che when the CR status is set to **Available**, and you see a URL to Eclipse Che.

    ## Defaults
    By default, the operator deploys Eclipse Che with:
    * Bundled PostgreSQL and Keycloak
    * Common PVC strategy
    * Auto-generated passwords
    * TLS mode (secure routes)
    * Communicate between components using internal cluster SVC names
    * Regular login extended with OpenShift OAuth authentication

    ## Installation Options
    Eclipse Che operator installation options include:
    * Connection to external database and Keycloak
    * Configuration of default passwords and object names
    * PVC strategy (once shared PVC for all workspaces, PVC per workspace, or PVC per volume)
    * Authentication options

    Use `oc edit checluster/eclipse-che -n eclipse-che` to update Eclipse Che configuration.
    See more configuration options in the [Installation guide](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/configuring-the-che-installation/).

    ### External Database and Keycloak
    Follow the guides to configure external [Keycloak](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/administration-guide/configuring-authorization/#configuring-che-to-use-external-keycloak_che)
    and [Database](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/administration-guide/external-database-setup/) setup.

    ### Certificates
    Operator uses a default router certificate to secure Eclipse Che routes.
    Follow the [guide](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installation-guide/importing-untrusted-tls-certificates/)
    to import certificates into Eclipse Che.
