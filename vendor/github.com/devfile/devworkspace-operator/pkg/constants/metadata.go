	// DevWorkspaceGitCredentialLabel is the label key to specify if the secret is a git credential. All secrets who
	// specify this label in a namespace will consolidate into one secret before mounting into a devworkspace.
	// Only secret data with the credentials key will be used and credentials must be the base64 encoded version
	//	of https://{USERNAME}:{PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}@{GIT_WEBSITE}
	// E.g. echo -n "https://{USERNAME}:{PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}@{GIT_WEBSITE}" | base64

	// within a directory, erasing all contents of the directory. Mounting via "subpath" leaves existing files in the
	// mount directory changed, but prevents on-cluster changes to the configmap/secret propagating to the container
